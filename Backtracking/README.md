# Backtracking

This folder contains Backtracking pattern problems and solutions in Java.

Currently implemented:

- `Permutations.java` — generate all permutations of an integer array (demo in `main`).
- `NQueens.java` — classic N-Queens solver returning board configurations (demo in `main`).

Feel free to add more problems (Subsets, Word Search, Sudoku solver, Combination Sum, Knight's Tour, etc.).
